						internal configuration
						management initiatives, aiming to enhance the overall ease of use of our software. My tenure at
						<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.verto.health">Verto</a> provided valuable
						opportunities for skill growth as I actively participated in significant projects across various

					<p> During my time at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.irisradgroup.com/">IRIS</a>,
						I was a Fullstack Developer with a primary emphasis on
						leveraging sensor data and advanced computer vision tools to forecast key performance indicators
						for road damage. I implemented my algorithm using Python, seamlessly integrating it
						into our existing codebase. Additionally, I contributed by developing and integrating small-scale
						features, enriching the functionality of the company's internal road tracking application.

						engineering design club;
						our mission
						was to create a SaaS business focused on predicting electrical asset failures for utility
						companies. We partnered with Utilities Kingston to
						develop an early stage proof of concept and participated in the 2020 Canadian
						Undergraduate Conference for AI (CUCAI) pitch competition. We placed first and gained the
						opportunity to pursue the project further with Kingston Utilities. However, due to COVID-19 the
						project was cancelled.</p>

						the
						customer-experience and
						reliability team.
						As a technical intern, my role involved creating reports and KPIs for all key account customers.
						During my time, I created a interactive
						dashboard using Tableau and Alteryx to give a visual KPI evaluations and rankings comparing all
						key accounts
						on the electric grid. I then worked with the IT department to productionalize these dashboards
						to be used
						throughout
						the company. My dashboard helped reduce creating reports by 30 minutes.</p>

					<h3>Dealsmate </h3>
					<p>Dealsmate is a marketplace web application that allows users to create their shopping lists.
						Whenever items in the shopping lists go on sale, the app will notify the users and update them
						with new prices. This is done by using Selenium to scrape information on the website given the
						provided URL. Users have the option of editing their profiles and following other people's lists
						as well.<br />

					<h3>Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent </h3>
					<p>The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent is a tool that allows IT admins to retrieve hardware info
						about all server nodes that are connected within its local area network via an ethernet switch.
						Data is stored on a PostgreSQL database and can be used to generate future resource planning
						reports. Bash scripts were created and ran through a crontab job to automatically capture
						real-time
						memory-usage logs every
						minute. <br /><b>Tools Used: PostgreSQL, Docker, Google Cloud Platform, Bash scripting, and

					<h3>Smart Mirror </h3>
					<p> The Smart Mirror was my final year capstone project. The objective was to create a bathroom
						mirror interface that integrates with the customer's morning routine. The product is a monitor
						display contained within a built frame, with a two-way Plexi film over the screen. The mirror
						gives users a dynamic, hands-free visual interface through voice control via the Amazon echo.
						The mirror also has a motion sensor and automatically toggles on and off to conserve power.

					<h3>Power Line Fault Detection </h3>
					<p> The analysis looks at detecting partial discharges (PD) in power lines by evaluating
						disturbances within voltage signals. Early detection helps prevent damage made on electrical
						assets, leading to power outages or electrical fires. We used the VSB Power Line Fault Kaggle <a
							href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/vsb-power-line-fault-detection" class="link"
							target="_blank">dataset</a>
						,and the results of our model gave a precision score of 0.815 and an F1-score of 0.778. For
